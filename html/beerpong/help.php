    <p>
        The recommanded way to play is to either use a laptop with facebook: you can split screen your video conversation on one side, and display this site on the other side.
        Or you can also use two devices, your computer to display this site and your cellphone to chat with your friends.
        This site also works on cellphones but it's optimized for computers so you will have a better experience using your computer.
